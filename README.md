# Functional-Programming

This repository contains the module functions I implemented to solve given problems while learning Functional Programming (Haskell). These solutions may not be perfect or optimal by any means, but perhaps I will revisit and improve them one day.

- ``triple`` - Implement a function tripling a given numerical input

- ``collatz`` - Implement the Collatz conjecture

- ``halve`` - Implement a function that splits a list

- ``isLeapYear`` - Implement a function that computes whether a given year is a leap year

- ``find`` - Implement a function that searches a list for an item

- ``isPangram`` - Implement a pangram checker

- ``merge`` - Merge two sorted lists

- ``encrypt`` and ``decrypt`` - Encrypt text using Caesarâ€™s cipher

- ``increaseStock`` and ``decreaseStock`` - Define functions and data types for stock-keeping
